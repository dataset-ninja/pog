**POG: People on Grass Dataset** is a dataset for object detection and identification tasks. It is used in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 2892 images with 13713 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pedestrain*).

Images in the POG dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2496 images) and *val* (396 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 11 meta data: ***altitude_above_seaLevel(feet)*** (2892 images), ***compass_heading(degrees)*** (2892 images), ***datetime(utc)*** (2892 images), ***distance(feet)*** (2892 images), ***height_above_takeoff(feet)*** (2892 images), ***latitude*** (2892 images), ***longitude*** (2892 images), ***pitch(degrees)*** (2892 images), ***roll(degrees)*** (2892 images), ***speed(mph)*** (2892 images), and ***time(millisecond)*** (2892 images). **Note:** other metadata can be found in the dataset archive (file meta.csv). The dataset was released in 2023 by the University of TÃ¼bingen.
