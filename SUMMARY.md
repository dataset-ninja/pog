**POG: People on Grass Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 2892 images with 13713 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pedestrain*).

Images in the POG dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2496 images) and *val* (396 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 6 meta data: ***datetime*** (2892 images), ***distance*** (2892 images), ***latitude*** (2892 images), ***longitude*** (2892 images), ***speed*** (2892 images), and ***time*** (2892 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the University of TÃ¼bingen.
